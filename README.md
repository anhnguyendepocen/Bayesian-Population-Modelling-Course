This folder contains scripts and data for my part of the Advanced Population and Community Ecology masters Course at RUG.

**Recommended reading:**
KÃ©ry, Marc, and Michael Schaub. Bayesian population analysis using WinBUGS: a hierarchical perspective. Academic Press, 2011.

The course is based on Just another Gibbs Sampler (or shortly JAGS) software.
